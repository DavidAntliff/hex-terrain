# Log

Append-only, newest at the bottom. Keep the prefix consistent so it stays greppable:
`## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <title>`.

## [2026-08-12] init | spec tree created

- Established `spec/` with [[home]] as the index and [[conventions]] as the operating manual;
  templates for `spec` and `concept` notes under `_templates/`.
- Wrote [[sandbox-scene]] (`status: implemented`) covering the initial 3D scene, camera, skybox,
  and both build paths, at commit `d650ce8`.
- Compiled three knowledge pages from building it: [[bevy-0-19-api]], [[build-performance]],
  [[skybox-pipeline]].
